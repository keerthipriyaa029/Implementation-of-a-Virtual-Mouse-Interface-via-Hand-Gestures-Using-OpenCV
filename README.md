# Implementation-of-a-Virtual-Mouse-Interface-via-Hand-Gestures-Using-OpenCV
The project implements a gesture-controlled virtual mouse using OpenCV and MediaPipe. By tracking hand landmarks in real-time, it enables users to move the cursor, click, and scroll using natural finger gestures. The system enhances human-computer interaction by offering a touchless and intuitive control interface.
